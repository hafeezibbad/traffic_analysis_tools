This document describes the datasets which were used for analyzing network traffic from IoT devices. 
We categorize the list of devices based on device types, and list the scenarios for data collection. 
The datasets described in this paper were collected from previously published research, as well as in the \iotlab setup at University of Helsinki.
Detailed information about each of the publically reported dataset is available in the original paper(s). 
This report is meant as a reference material for iot traffic analysis experiments. 
The report also contains a detailed description about the dataset collected from IoTLab, set up at University of Helsinki. 
We present a list of IoT devices and different scenarios considered in collection of this dataset.
