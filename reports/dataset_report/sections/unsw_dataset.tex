% Brief summary comes here
\unswlab dataset was collected by IoT Analytics lab at University of New South Wales, over a period of 6 months (1 Oct, 2016 - 13 Apr, 2017). 
This dataset was reported in ~\cite{DBLP:journals/tmc/SivanathanGLRWV19}.

\subsection{Devices}
\label{sec:unswlab_devices}
% Description about devices come here 
The dataset was collected using 28 devices including lights, camera, plugs, motion sensor, and health appliances.
A list of these devices including MAC address and OUI information is listed in Table~\ref{tbl:unswlab_device_last}~\ref{DBLP:journals/tmc/SivanathanGLRWV19}.

The dataset was collected in a ``smart environment'' where all IoT and non-IoT devices were connected to a TP-Link Archer C7 v2 \wifi access point, flashed with OpenWrt Firmware Chaos Calmer (15.05.1, r48532). 
This \wifi access point served as gateway to public internet, and all the traffic passing through this endpoint was collected using \texttt{tcpdump}. 
The data contains raw trace data including packet headers and payload information. 
On average, the size of logs generated by each device vary between 61MB to 2GB, with an average of 365MB.

\subsection{Experiments}
\label{sec:unswlab_experiments}
% Description about how dataset was collected. 
The dataset contains data from several activity patters, including
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Idle traffic}: Traffic generated by the device automatically, for example, DNS, NTP
\item \textbf{Interaction traffic}: Traffic generated due to user interactions 
\end{itemize}

% Summary statistics about dataset come here 
There are 20 pcap files available in the dataset available at \url{https://iotanalytics.unsw.edu.au/iottraces.html}. 
For each of the pcap file, there is a `csv` file which contains following data for given trace. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Packet ID}: Reference packet number in the trace
\item \textit{Time}: Timestamp of packet arrival 
\item \textit{Size}: Packet size
\item \textit{eth.src}: Source MAC address
\item \textit{eth.dst}: Destination MAC address
\item \textit{IP.src}: Source IP address
\item \textit{IP.dst}: Destination IP address
\item \textit{IP.proto}: IP Protocol number 
\item \textit{port.src}: Source port number 
\item \textit{port.dst}: Destination port number
\end{itemize}
